Exports Formidable Forms into PDF files.

== Description ==

Formidable Pro PDF Exporter allows to export Formidable Forms into PDF files with user-defined layout.

* Exporting into PDF

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Unzip the archive and upload `fpropdf` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Make sure that you have Formidable Forms plugin installed and activated, that you have at least one Formidable form, and at least one form entry.
4. Choose "New Field Map" in "Field Map to use" 
5. Click "Upload a PDF file" in "Field Map Designer" section. Press "Upload", and choose your new layout in "Layout to use"
6. After this, add some mappings for your PDF file in "Manage your custom layout here" section.
7. You can now use the shortcode or press "Export" button to download PDFs.

Please note that we use [PDFTK](https://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-man-page/) to fill in PDF files. This also means that your server has to have PHP shell commands enabled. If your server does not have `pdftk` installed, you can still use the plugin. In this case, you can generate 1 PDF file for 1 Formidable form.

Nevertheless, you can [purchase](http://formidablepro2pdf.com/) the plugin using [our website](http://formidablepro2pdf.com/). In this case, you do not need to install `pdftk` or to enable shell commands on your server. You can use our API according to the [Terms of Service](http://formidablepro2pdf.com/terms-of-service/). Just enter the activation code on the plugin options page.
